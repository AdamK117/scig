# scig (functional spec)
*This document outlines `scig`'s behaviors, interface, and design. It is a blueprint from which `scig` will be built and isn't suitable as documentation.*

## Terminology

- "The device" refers to some sort of hardware that is connected to the computer running `scig`. In technical terms, "the device" is a Data Communications Equipment (DCE) and the computer running `scig` is a Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)

## What is scig?
`scig` is a utility that makes interfacing with devices easier. While most *communication ports* allow for two-way uncoupled, asynchronous IO, many *devices* follow a simple plaintext command-response pattern. Manually writing implementations for communicating with those devices can be repetitive. There's also numerous gotchas when working so close to the hardware layer: some of those gotchas can hopefully be abstracted away by `scig`.

With `scig`, developers write a device specification file (`DEVICE_SPEC`). From that spec, `scig` generates a higher-level interface to the device. In this initial implementation, only a HTTP server can be generated from `DEVICE_SPEC`.

The core philosophy of `scig` is "write once, use everywhere". The `DEVICE_SPEC` is designed to be a simple declarative data structure that can be easily parsed. In the longer term, this declarative approach should enable `DEVICE_SPEC` repositories and specialized applications to be built more easily.

## Scope
The scope of this version of `scig` is:

- An initial implementation of `scig` that has the `start` context and `start http` command
- The resulting `http` server is barebones and only supports a `json` data format
- A limited implementation of the `DEVICE_SPEC` file

Known major limitations are:

- Only support for static text templates and regex patterns when defining commands
- No support for connection handshakes (software/hardware)
- No support for higher-level return types (e.g. arrays) from commands
- No support for in-depth device details (dimensions, images, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
$ scig [--help] <command> [<args>]
$ scig start [--help]
$ scig start <process_type> [--help] [<args>]
$ scig start http [--help] [--port] <device_spec_file> <device_port>
```

## Examples

```bash
# Show the usage and <command>s listing
$ scig

# Show scig general help
$ scig --help

# Show help for `scig start`
$ scig start --help

# Show help for `scig start http`
$ scig start http --help

# Start a scig http server for controlling
# the device (windows port identifier)
$ scig start http device-spec COM4

# Start a http server for controlling
# the device (*nix port identifier)
$ scig start http device-spec /dev/ttyS0

# Start a scig http server on port 80
# for controlling the device
$ scig start http --port 80 device-spec /dev/ttyS0
```

## scig

- `scig` is the application's name
- `scig` is used through a standard command-line interface
- Named arguments to `scig`'s command-line interface begin with one or two dashes (e.g. `-h` and `--help`)
- Unnamed arguments passed to `scig` change its context. For example, passing `start` to `scig` will change its context such that it then accepts further arguments related to `start`ing a process.
- The effect of arguments passed to `scig` depends on `scig`'s context. For example, passing only `--help` to `scig` will show `scig`'s general help page; however, passing both `start` and `--help` will show the more specific `scig start` help page.
- In this initial implementation, `scig` only supports changing its context *via* a single unnamed argumentâ€”`start`. Later versions of `scig` will support other subcommands (e.g. `compile` or `generate`)
- Named options (e.g. `--port`) are collected by `scig` regardless of their location in a `scig`'s argument list. For example, "`scig --help start`" will exhibit the same behavior as "`scig start --help`". Likewise, "`scig --port 80 start http`" will exhibit the same behavior as "`scig start http --port 80`".
- If invalid arguments are supplied to `scig` call then the `scig` process will write usage instructions to the standard error (`STDERR`) followed by terminating with an exit code of `1` (general error)
- If insufficient arguments are supplied to a `scig` call then the `scig` process will write the help documentation to the standard error followed by terminating with an exit code of `1` (general error)
- Regardless of context, specifying unrecognized arguments (for example, `--foo=bar`) will result in `scig` writing an error message to the standard error (`STDERR`) followed by terminating with an exit code of `1` (general error)

## `scig` Command-Line Options
These command line options are available from the base context of `scig`. That is, the context of `scig` when no `command` unnamed arguments are provided to it.

### `-h, --help`
Show the general help documentation for `scig`.

   - The help documentation will be written to the standard output

	 - Contains a usage statement
	 - Contains a list of arguments for the base context
	 - Contains a list of `command`s and their purpose

  - (*cont.*) After the documentation has been written to the standard output, the `scig` process will terminate with an exit code `0` (no error)

## `scig` `<command>`s
`scig` is composed of individual commands that each have their own command-specific options and behaviours. When calling `scig`, the name of the command is given (e.g. `scig start`) followed by command-specific options and arguments (e.g. `scig start http --port 80 /dev/ttyS0 input-file`). In this inital release, `scig` only supports the `start` command.

  - The first unnamed argument supplied to `scig` is a `command` identifier
  - If no unnamed arguments are provided, `scig` should remain in its base context
  - If an unnamed argument is provided but it is not a known `command` identifier, `scig` shall write the following message to the standard error:

  > `scig: '$first_argument' is not a scig command. See 'scig --help'.`

  - (*cont.*) After printing the error message, the `scig` process shall exit with a return code of `1` (general error)

### `scig start`

- `start` is a `scig` `command`
- `scig start` is the syntax to start an ongoing process such as a server or CLI client
- In general, if an initialization error occurs, the `scig start` process shall write error/feedback messages to the standard error followed by terminating with a return code of `1` (general error)
- Once initialized, a `scig start` process will continually run until it is explicitly stopped
- When started via a CLI, the `scig start` process may be terminated using the `CTRL+C` combination. If this is used, `scig` will exit with a return code of `130`
- While running, the `scig start` process writes errors to the standard error (`STDERR`).
- What `scig start` writes to the standard output on the type of process that was started. For example, `http` shall write a human-readable representation of any HTTP request the server's port recieves
- `<process_type>` is case-sensitive and, in this initial implementation only `http` is supported
- If no unnamed arguments are supplied to `scig start` then `scig` will write the `scig start` help documentation to the standard output followed by terminating with an exit code of `0`

### `scig start` Options

### `-h, --help`
Show the usage of the `scig start` command, options, and available subcommands (e.g. `http`).

 - The help documentation will be written to the standard output

     - Contains a general header explaining `scig start`
	 - Contains a usage statement
	 - Contains a list of commands for the `start` context
	 - Contains example usage cases

 - (*cont.*) After the documentation has been written to the standard output, the `scig` process will terminate with an exit code of `0` (no error)

### `scig start` `<command>`s
In this initial release, the only supported command is `http`.

#### `scig start http`
Starts a server that allows the device's details, commands, and documentation to be requested with standard http requests.

#### `scig start http` Usage

    scig start http [--port=<port>] device_spec_file device_port

#### `scig start http` Options

##### `-h, --help`
*Optional*. Shows the `http` command's documentation, outlining its usage, options, and examples.

 - The help documentation will be written to the standard output

   - Contains a general header explaining `scig start http`
   - Contains a usage statement
   - Contains a list of arguments for the `http` context
   - Contains example usage cases

 - (*cont.*) After the documentation has been written to the standard output, the `scig` process will terminate with an exit code of `0` (no error)

##### `-p=<port>, --port=<port>`
*Required*. The TCP port that the `scig` http server should listen on.

  - `<port>` is validated and allocated during the initialization of `scig`
  - A malformed `<port>` will result in the following message being written to the standard error:

  > `scig: The supplied port ($<port>) is not valid. The port must be a number between 1-65535`.

  - (*cont.*) After writing that error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an exit code of `1` (general error)
  - If `<port>` is already in use by another process then the following message shall be written to the standard error:

 > `scig: The supplied port ($<port>) is currently in use by another process: $process_details`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an exit code of `1` (general error)
  - If `scig` process has insufficient privellages to open `<port>` then the following message shall be written the standard error:

  > `scig: Cannot open the supplied port ($<port>). Access is denied.`

  - (*cont.*) After writing that error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an exit code of `1` (general error)

##### `device_spec_file`
*Required*. A path to a file containing a `DEVICE_SPEC`.

  - A non-existient `device_spec_file` path will result in the following error message being written to the standard output (`STDERR`):

  > `scig: $device_spec_file: No such file or directory`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an error code of `1` (general error)
  - `scig` requires non-exclusive read access to `device_spec_file` at initialization time. If another process has locked `device_spec_file` from read access then the following message will be written to the standard error (`STDERR`)

  > `scig: Cannot open $device_spec_file. It is in use by another process ($process_information)`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an error code of `1` (general error)
  - If the `scig` process does not have sufficient privellages to read `device_spec_file` then the following message will be written to the standard error:

  > `scig: Cannot open $device_spec_file. Insufficient privellages.`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an error code of `1` (general error)
  - The `scig` process should open `device_spec_file` with shared read access permissions
  - The `scig` process should read the entire contents of `device_spec_file` at initialization time
  - Once the `scig` process finished reading `device_spec_file`, it should release its handle. This is to facilicate scenarios in which many `scig` processes are created from the same `device_spec_file`
  - The general format of `device_spec_file` is that it must be a text file that uses a standard character_encoding (utf-8). If `device_spec_file` does not have that format then the following message will be written to the standard error:

  > `scig: The format of $device_spec_file is not recognized. device_spec_file should be a plaintext file that uses a standard text character_encoding convention (e.g. utf-8)`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an error code of `1` (general error)
  - The text content of `device_spec_file` must follow the schema specified in `DEVICE_SPEC`. If it does not then the following error message with this general format will be written to the standard error (`STDERR`):

  > `$device_spec_file: $parse_error_message`

  - (*cont.*) One of these messages will be generated for each error encountered in `device_spec_file`. The `DEVICE_SPEC` parser is responsible for returning the appropriate line number, column number, and error message. After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an error code of `1` (general error)

#### `device_port`
*Required*. The port that the device is connected to (e.g. `COM1` on Windows systems or `/dev/ttyS0` on *nix systems).

  - `device_port` is validated and allocated during the initialization of `scig`
  - A malformed `device_port` value will result in the following error message being written to the standard error:

  > `scig: The supplied device port ($device_port) is not a valid serial port identifier. $platform_dependant_text`

  - (*cont.*) The error message will contain platform-dependant messages. This is because operating systems have differing methods of identifying communication ports (e.g. `COMn` in windows, `/dev/ttySn` in *nix). After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an exit code of `1` (general error)
  - A valid, but non-existient, `device_port` value will result in the following messge being written to the standard error:

  > `scig: The supplied serial port ($device_port) does not exist.`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminate with an error code of `1` (general error)
  - `scig` needs exclusive read/write access to `device_port`. If `device_port` is already being in use by another process then the following message will be written to the standard error:

  > `scig: The supplied serial port ($device_port) is already in use by another process ($process_details)`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will be terminated with an error code of `1` (general error)
  - The `scig` process having insufficient privellages to open `device_port` will result in the following message being written to the standard error

  > `scig: Cannot open the supplied serial port ($device_port). Access is denied.`

  - (*cont.*) After writing the error message, the `scig` process will terminated with an error code of `1` (general error)

## `DEVICE_SPEC`
`DEVICE_SPEC` is the most important part of `scig`. In it, the specification of a device is described declaratively. With that in mind, several high-level design choices were made when specifying `DEVICE_SPEC`:

  - It should be human-readable and self-explanatory
  - It should be easy for other applications to parse
  - It should be extensible, allowing additional information to be implanted into it

I initially considered a custom grammar for `DEVICE_SPEC`. However, that would make it difficult for other applications to parse `DEVICE_SPEC` files. Based on that, I investigated using `xml`, `json`, and `yaml`. Most general-purpose programming languages have parsers for these three formats. Prototype implementations of `DEVICE_SPEC` in these grammars are available in the `prototypes/` folder.

`xml` is by far the most mature and feature-rich of the three; however, it isn't particularly easy to read. `json` has fewer features than `xml` and is easier to both read and write; however, it still contains a decent amount of parentheses and delimiters. `yaml` has a roughly equivalent feature set to `json` but has fewer delimiters; however, it is whitespace-based, which many developers dislike.

Overall, `yaml` was chosen because:

  - "it should be human-readable and self-explanatory" is important.
  - `yaml` parsers are available in most languages
  - It supports multiline strings, which will be important if an expressions engine is ever implemented into `scig`.
  - It supports comments, which are important because a `scig` writer may want to explain part of the device spec (which feeds into the "it should be human-readable and self-explanatory goal")

`DEVICE_SPEC` is a *text* specification, not a *cli* specification because a `scig` library user may parse an in-memory string containing the `DEVICE_SPEC`. Because of that, the error messages described in this section should be handled according to the context. For example, as described above, the `scig` CLI shall write errors to the standard error followed by terminating with an exit code of `1`. A library implementation may throw an exception containing the applicable error message.

There are several key points about the structure of `DEVICE_SPEC`:

 - `DEVICE_SPEC` follows a `yaml` structure
 - In this section, "keys" refer to the field names within the file (e.g. `foo_key: foo_value`)
 - Although not strictly required by the `yaml` specification, it is reccomended that keys in `DEVICE_SPEC` be alphanumeric and `camel_case`.
 - While `yaml` support multiline `value`s, most of `scig`'s fields should span a single line. A syntax error will be produced if a multiline value is encounted for a `scig` field that is explicitally single line

`scig`'s `DEVICE_SPEC` parser shall produce four different types of messages:

  - `ERROR` - The parser enountered a fatal error in `DEVICE_SPEC` that prevents the parse process from completing
  - `WARNING` - The parser encountered a non-fatal issue with `DEVICE_SPEC`.
  - `LINT` - The parser enountered a stylistic issue with `DEVICE_SPEC`.
  - `FEEDBACK` - General feedback about the `DEVICE_SPEC` parsing process


`DEVICE_SPEC` should be a valid `yaml` grammar. If it is not, then then following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `The supplied scig DEVICE_SPEC does not appear to be a valid yaml file. $yaml_parser_error`

(*cont.*) The `$yaml_parser_error` should contain the line and column number of where a parse error occured.

## `DEVICE_SPEC` Example

```yaml
{% include device-spec-example.yml %}
```

### `DEVICE_SPEC "device:"` Keys
Keys within `device:` state what the device *is*.

### `identifier: DEVICE_IDENTIFIER`
*Required*. A programmatic identifier for the device.

  - A valid `DEVICE_IDENTIFIER` begins with a standard alphabetical letter followed by alphanumeric characters. If it does not, then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: The supplied identifier, $DEVICE_IDENTIFIER, is invalid. The identifier must begin with a standard alphabetical letter (a-z) followed by alphanumeric characters. Words within the identifier should be separated by underscores. For example, "identifier: autosampler_9000"`

  - `DEVICE_IDENTIFIER` should be written in `camel_case`. Individual words within `DEVICE_IDENTIFIER` should be separated with underscores (e.g. `my_programattic_name`).
  - The case of alphabetical characters within `DEVICE_IDENTIFIER` is ignored. If `DEVICE_IDENTIFIER` contains uppercase characters, the following `WARNING` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: The supplied identifier, $PROGRAMMATIC_NAME, contains uppercase characters. This is not a problem; however, scig will ignore the case of characters within $PROGRAMMATIC_NAME. It is reccomended you use an all lower-case camel_case name. For example, "my_device", rather than "My_Device". "identifer:" is only used programatically. You can specify a case-sensitive name for the device in the "name:" field`

  - The absence of an `identifier:` key will result in the following `ERROR` being issued:

  >`line:col: device does not contain a "identifier" key. scig requires an "identifer:" key to be present with a valid programmatic name for the device. For example, "identifier: autosampler_9000"`

- `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` cannot be a commonly used programming keyword (see appendix: "common reserved words"); for example, "`if`". If `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` is a commonly used keyword then the following `ERROR` shall be issued.

  > `line:col: The supplied identifier, $DEVICE_IDENTIFIER, is a common programming keyword. Identifiers must uniquely identify the device but also have a small chance of being confused with a keyword when used in code. Identifiers must also begin with a standard alphabetical letter (a-z) followed by alphanumeric characters. Words within the identifier should be separated by underscores. For example, "identifier: autosampler_9000"`

### `name: DEVICE_NAME`
*Required*. The name of the device.

  - `DEVICE_NAME` must contain at least one non-whitespace character. If it does not then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: The supplied name for the device is blank.`

  - `DEVICE_NAME` cannot contain multiple lines. If it does, then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: The supplied name for the device contains newlines. The device name must span a single line. For example, "name: Acme Autosampler 9000"`

  - In addition to the whitespace restrictions, `DEVICE_NAME` must only contain ASCII characters. If non-ASCII characters are used in `DEVICE_NAME` then the following `ERRROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col The supplied name for the device contains special (non-ASCII) characters. This initial implementation of scig only supports ASCII characters in names`

  - The absence of an `name:` key will result in the following `ERROR` being issued:

  > `device: does not contain a "name" key. scig requires a "name:" key to be present with the name of the device as its value. For example, "name: Acme Autosampler 9000"`

### `metadata: METADATA_KEY_VALUES`
*Optional*. Additional related metadata about the device.

  - Metadata is expressed as `key: value` pairs.
  - Metadata is guaranteed to have no reserved keys within it. Arbitrary `key: value` pairs can be put into the `metadata:` field without them being invalidated in later versions of `scig`.
  - The `metadata:` key is optional. Its absence shall be treated as "no metadata" (i.e. an empty `metadata` hashtable)
  - If the `metadata:` key is present but no `key: value` pairs can be found within it then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: A metadata key was specified but no values were found within it. "metadata:" is optional, and can be ommited if no metadata is available`

  - If `METADATA_KEY_VALUES` are not `key: value` pairs (e.g. a string value was given) then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: Invalid metadata key value. The metadata key should contain a set of key-value pairs`

  - If duplicate `key`'s are found in `METADATA_KEY_VALUES` then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: A duplicate delcaration of $key was found in the metadata field`

### `image: DEVICE_IMAGE_PATH`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `manufacturer: MANUFACTURER`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `other_names: OTHER_NAMES`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `DEVICE_SPEC "connection:"` Keys
These keys contain information about the physical connection to the device. In this initial implementation of `scig`, only `RS232` connections are supported.

### `baud_rate: BAUD_RATE`
*Required*. The baud rate of the connection in bits per second (bps).

  - If `BAUD_RATE` is not a positive integer then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: Invalid baud rate. The baud rate is in bits per second and must be a positive integer. For example, "baud_rate: 9600"`

  - If the `baud_rate` key is absent, then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: connection does not contain a "baud_rate" key. scig requires a baud_rate key with a valid value. For example, "baud_rate: 9600"`

### `parity: PARITY (even|odd|none)`
*Required*. The parity of the connection.

  - `PARITY` is case-sensitive and must have a value of `even`, `odd`, or `none`. If `PARITY` is invalid, the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: Invalid value for parity. Supported values are even, odd, or none. For example: "parity: even".`

  - If the `parity:` key is absent, then the following error shall be issued:

  > `line:col: connection does not contain a "parity" key. scig requires a parity key with a value of even, odd, or none. For example: "parity: even".`

### `data_bits: DATA_BITS (1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8)`
*Required*. The number of data bits per packet of data sent through the connection.

  - If `DATA_BITS` is not `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, or `8` then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: Invalid value for data_bits ($DATA_BITS). The value must be either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8. For example, "data_bits: 8".`

  - If the `data_bits` key is absent then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: connection does not contain a "data_bits" key. scig requires a data_bits key with a value of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8. For example, "data_bits: 8".`

### `stop_bits: STOP_BITS (0|1|1.5|2)`
*Required*. The number of stop bits that terminate a data packet sent through the connection.

  - If `STOP_BITS` is not `0`, `1`, `1.5`, or `2` then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: Invalid value for stop_bits. The value must be either 0, 1, 1.5, or 2. For example, "stop_bits: 1".`

  - If the `stop_bits` key is absent then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: connection does not contain a "stop_bits" key. scig requires a stop_bits key with a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4. For example, "stop_bits: 4".`

### `timeout: TIMEOUT (N ms|s) (default: 20 ms)`
*Optional*. The maximum timespan a read/write operation through the connection can take before timing out.

  - If a `timeout:` key is not supplied, a default `TIMEOUT` of `20 ms` is used. If the default is used, `DEVICE_SPEC` linters shall issue the following `LINT` advice:

  > `line:col connection does not contain a timeout value. scig will default to a timeout of "20 ms"; however, it is reccomended that you explicitly set a representative timeout value for the $DEVICE_NAME. For example: "timeout: 1 s"`

  - If a `timeout:` key is supplied then `TIMEOUT` must have the form "`N` `unit`" where `N` is a positive integer and `unit` is either `ms` (milliseconds) or `s` (seconds). If the format of `TIMEOUT` is invalid then an `ERROR` shall be issued:

> `line:col connection timeout is invalid. Timeouts must be specified as a positive integer followed by the time's unit of measure (either ms or s). For example, "timeout: 20 ms"`

### `character_encoding: CHARACTER_ENCODING (ascii)`
*Required* The character encoding of data sent through the connection.

  - Any strings sent to the device first need to be converted into binary
  - To do that, the string shall be encoded with the specified `CHARACTER_ENCODING`
  - Any binary recieved from the device needs to be converted into a string
  - To do that, any binary recieved from the device shall be decoded with the specified `CHARACTER_ENCODING`
  - The only supported `CHARACTER_ENCODING` is `ascii`. If `CHARACTER_ENCODING` has a value other than `ascii` then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col connection character_encoding is not valid. The character_encoding must be ascii (this version of scig only supports ascii). For example, "character_encoding: ascii"`

  - If the `character_encoding:` key is absent then the following `ERROR` shall be issued

  > `line:col connection does not contain an "character_encoding" key. scig requires an character_encoding key with a value of ascii (this version of scig only supports ascii). For example, "character_encoding: ascii"`

### `string_terminator: TERMINATOR (\r\n|\n)`
*Required*. The characters that indicate the end of string sent through the connection.

  - `TERMINATOR` shall be used to construct a string when reading signals from the device
  - `TERMINATOR` shall be appended to the end of any strings sent to the device
  - `TERMINATOR` must have a value of either `\r\n` or `\n`. If `TERMINATOR` is invalid then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col connection string_terminator is not a valid. The string terminator must be either '\n' or '\r\n'. For example: "string_terminator: \n"`

  - If the `terminator:` key is absent then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col connection does not contain a "string_terminator" key. scig requires a string_terminator key with a value of \n or \r\n. For example, "string_terminator: \r\n"`

### `use_hardware_flow_control: USE_HARDWARE_FLOW_CONTROL (true|false)`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `software_flow_control: SOFTWARE_FLOW_CONTROL`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `use_carrier_detect_signal: USE_CARRIER_DETECT_SIGNAL (true|false)`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `use_ring_indicator: USE_RING_INDICATOR (true|false)`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `handshake: HANDSHAKE`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `use_dtr_handshake: HANDSHAKE`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `use_dsr_handshake: HANDSHAKE`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a `WARNING` that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `DEVICE_SPEC commands:` Keys
*Optional* The `commands` key contains an array of `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`s that describe, delcaratively, the possible commands that the device can recieve (via the connection).

`COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`s are a core part of the `DEVICE_SPEC` because they allow authors to specify the actions of the device in a declarative, high-level way.

The `commands:` key has the following stucture:

```yaml
commands:
  COMMAND_IDENTIFIER:
    COMMAND_DESCRIPTION
  COMMAND_IDENTIFIER:
    COMMAND_DESCRIPTION
```

Behaviors:

  - `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` must begin with a standard alphabetical letter followed by alphanumeric characters. If it does not, then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: The supplied command identifier, $COMMAND_IDENTIFIER, is invalid. A command identifier must begin with a standard alphabetical letter (a-z) and can be followed by alphanumeric characters and underscores. Words within the command identifier should be separated by underscores. For example: "get_sample_list:"`

  - `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` should be written in `camel_case`. That is, individual words within `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` should be seaprated with underscores (e.g. `foo_command`)
  - The case of alphabetical characters within `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` are ignored. If `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` contains uppercase characters, the following `WARNING` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: The supplied command identifier, $COMMAND_IDENTIFIER, contains uppercase characters. This is not a problem; however, scig will ignore the case of characters within $COMMAND_IDENTIFIER. It is reccomended you use an all lower-case camel_case name. For example, "my_device", rather than "My_Device". "identifer:" is only used programatically. You can specify a case-sensitive name for the device in the "name:" field`

  - Duplicate `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER`s within `commands:` are not allowed. If a duplicate `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` is encountered then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col: The supplied command identifier, $COMMAND_IDENTIFIER, already exists in the commands: list. Command identifiers must be unique. This error can be fixed by changing one of the command identifier to something else (that's unique).`

  -

**TODO**: Post-normalization name collisions

  - If a duplicate `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` appears within `commands:` then the following `ERROR` shall be issued:

  > `line:col TODO`

  - `COMMAND_IDENTIFIER` cannot be an established programming keyword **TODO**

## `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`
`COMMAND_DESCRIPTION` defines a command that the device can perform. Commands in this context are defined to be messages that the device can recieve and expected responses from the device. An example of a `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION` is:

```
summary: Set the position of the autosampler
  outgoing_message:
    format: SET_POS $sample_position
	$sample_position type: string
	$sample_position description: The position of the sample (e.g. A2)
  expected_response:
    pattern: ^(.+?) (.+?)$
    $1 type: string
    $1 description: The autosampler's previous position
    $2 type: int
    $2 description: The transaction id
```

The following keys make up a `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`:

### `summary: COMMAND_SUMMARY`
*Required*. A summary of the command's behavior.

  - `COMMAND_SUMMARY` is typically a one-sentence, readable description of the command.
  - `COMMAND_SUMMARY` can be any valid string; however, line breaks will be stripped from `COMMAND_SUMMARY` to produce a single-line string
  - `COMMAND_SUMMARY` must contain at least one non-whitespace character. If it does not, then the following error shall be issued:

  > `line:col summary: must contain at least one non-whitespace character. The summary is typically a one-sentence, readable description of the command. For example: "summary: Set the position of the autosampler"`

  - If the `summary:` key is absent from the `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION` then the following error shall be issued:

  > `line:col $COMMAND_IDENTIFIER must contain a "summary" key. The summary is typically a one-sentence, readable description of the command. For example: "summary: Get the name of the autosampler"`

### `description: COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`
*Reserved*. `scig` shall produce a warning that this key is reserved and issues may be encountered with future versions of `scig` if it is used.

### `outgoing_message: OUTGOING_MESSAGE`
*Required*. A specification of the message that will be sent to the device.

  - `OUTGOING_MESSAGE` describes the actual string that is sent to the device.
  - `OUTGOING_MESSAGE` follows the specification outlined in the "`OUTGOING_MESSAGE` Specification" (below). The specification describes any errors that `OUTGOING_MESSAGE` may contain (and the appropriate error message)
  - If the `outgoing_message:` key is absent from `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION` then the following error shall be issued:

  > `line:col $COMMAND_IDENTIFIER must contain an "ougoing_message" key. The outgoing_message key describes the string that will be sent to the $DEVICE_NAME.`

### `expected_response: nothing|ignore|EXPECTED_RESPONSE`
*Required*. The the expected response from the device after sending it the outgoing message.

  - If `nothing` is written as the expected response, then it is assumed that the device should not send a response to the `OUTGOING_MESSAGE`. In that case, recieving a response from the device after sending the `OUTGOING_MESSAGE` is considered to be a runtime error.
  - If `ignore` is written as the expected response, then it is assumed that, at runtime, the device shall send a message in response to the `OUTGOING_MESSAGE` but the implementation should do nothing with the message content. If the device does not send a response within the specified `timeout` period then a runtime timout error shall occur.
  - If an `EXPECTED_RESPONSE` is written as the expected response, then that shall be handled as outlined in the `EXPECTED_RESPONSE` specification (below).
  - `EXPECTED_RESPONSE` describes the expected structure of the string that is recieved from the device in response to the outgoing command.
  - `EXPECTED_RESPONSE` follows the specification outlined in the "`EXPECTED_RESPONSE` Specification" (below). The specification describes any errors that `EXPECTED_RESPONSE` may contain (and the appropriate error message).
  - If the `incoming_response_template:` key is absent from the `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION` then it is assumed that that device should not respond to the outgoing command

## `OUTGOING_MESSAGE` Specification
`OUTGOING_MESSAGE` describes the format of messages sent to the device.  It is engineered to handle both static commands that never change and commands that have some variance. An example of a static command would be:

```
    outgoing_message:
		is_always: TAKE_MEASUREMENT
```

An example of an `OUTGOING_MESSAGE` that supports variance is:

```
	outgoing_message:
	    format: OUT_NAME $new_name
		$new_name type: string
		$new_name description: The new name of the device
```

### `has_format: TEMPLATE`
*Required*. A template string containing the characters of a command.

  - `TEMPLATE` must span one line only
  - `TEMPLATE` begins at the first non-whitespace character that occurs after the `format:` key. If a message must begin with a whitespace character then it should be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

- If `TEMPLATE` contains characters that are not supported by the chosen `CHARACTER_ENCODING` then a compile-time error will occur
- If `TEMPLATE` contains the device's command `TERMINATOR` then a compile/runtime **warning** will be generated

#### Variables
Variables may be declared within `TEMPLATE`. However, several rules must be followed:

  - Variable declarations begin with a dollar sign (`$`) followed by a `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` that begins with a letter followed by letters, numbers, or underscores (i.e. `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`).
  - A variable declaration is terminated by a single space or semicolon (`;`). Using a semicolon is reccomended if the format string does not require a literal sapce after the declaration's location (e.g. `foo$a;bar`, rather than `foo$a bar`, which would introduce a space after `$a`'s value in the output string).
  - If a literal `$` symbol is required in `TEMPLATE` then it must be escaped with a backslash (`\$`).
  - The same `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` may be used multiple times within `TEMPLATE`. At runtime, the output implementation will copy the sole supplied value for `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` to the specified locations within `TEMPLATE`.
  - Each `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` in `TEMPLATE` must have a corresponding `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER description:` key in the `outgoing_command_format:`. An invalid `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER`, or the absence of a `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER description: ` key will result in a compile error.

The absence of a `template:` key for a message format specification will result in a compile error. An invalid, or multi-line `TEMPLATE` will result in a compile error.

### `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER description: VARIABLE_DESCRIPTION`
*Required, if `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` was declared in `TEMPLATE`*. A human-readable description of `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER`'s purpose. This must be supplied if `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` was declaraed in `TEMPLATE`; otherwise, a compile error will occur. If `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` was not declared in `TEMPLATE` (as in, it's a redundant description) then a compile error will also occur.

### `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER type: VARIABLE_TYPE (string|int|decimal) (default: string)`
*Optional. However, `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFER` must be declared in `TEMPLATE`.* The data type of values assigned to the `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` defined in the `TEMPLATE`.

`VARIABLE_TYPE` must have a value of either `string`, `int`, or `decimal`. If supplied, `VARIABLE_TYPE` is used as a type annotation in output implementations. If the `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER type: ` key is not supplied then the variable's type is assumed to be `string`. If a `VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER type: ` key is specified but `$VARIABLE_IDENTIFIER` could not be found in `TEMPLATE` then a compile error will occur. An invalid value for `VARIABLE_TYPE` will also result in a compile error.

### `follows_expression: EXPRESSION`
*Reserved*

### `has_form: FORM`
*Reserved*

## `EXPECTED_RESPONSE` Specification
`EXPECTED_RESPONSE` describes the format of messages recieved from the device after sending an outgoing command.

It is fundamentally assumed that `scig` is a high-level application for processing textâ€”not binaryâ€”device responses. Binary signals recieved from the device shall be decoded according to the device's `character_encoding:` key (e.g. `ASCII`) until the `terminator:` (e.g. `\r\n`) pattern is reached. The resulting string, not including the terminator, is assumed to be the full, raw response from the device.

The raw response is parsed according to the definitions in the `incoming_response_template:` section of a command. If the response does not match the specified pattern or data types then a runtime error will occur.

For example, the specification of a response that is always the same is:

```
incoming_response_template:
	pattern: OK
```

If the device does not respond with "`OK`" then a runtime error will occur.

An example of a response that needs to be parsed for a single variable would be:

```
incoming_response_template:
	pattern: NEW_NAME_IS (.+)
	$1 identifier: new_name
	$1 description: The device's new name
```
If the device does not respond with, for example, "`NEW_NAME_IS FOO_DEVICE`" then a runtime error will occur.

An example of a response that needs to be parsed for multiple variables would be:

```
incoming_response_template:
	pattern: OLD_NAME_WAS (.+?) NUMBER_OF_NAME_CHANGES (\d+)
	$1 identifier: old_name
	$1 description: The old name of the device
	$2 identifier: number_of_name_changes
	$2 desctiption: The number of times the name has changed
	$2 type: int
```

If the device does not respond with, for example, "`OLD_NAME_WAS FOO NUMBER_OF_NAME_CHANGES 3`" then a runtime error will occur. Also, because the second capture group's type is `int` but `\d+` may also match decimals (e.g. `3.3`) a runtime error would still occur for a response of "`OLD_NAME_WAS FOO NUMBER_OF_NAME_CHANGES 3.3`". This is because, even though the response matches the specified `pattern`, the capture group could not be parsed into an `int` datatype.

### Specification Keys

### `pattern: PATTERN`
The expected pattern of characters that is expected to be recieved from the device in response to a command. `PATTERN` must be a valid regular expression. The ECMAScript flavour of regex shall be used. The raw response from the device will be matched against this regular expression. If a match cannot be found then a runtime error will occur.

#### Capture Groups
ECMAScript regex supports capture groups of the form `(`*expr*`)`. Capture groups may be used in `PATTERN` to indicate that the character pattern should be captured, parsed, and returned by output implementations. There are several considerations to using capture groups:

- For each capture group in `PATTERN`, there must be corresponding `$`*n* `identifier` and `$`*n* `description` keys (see below) where *n* is the index (within `PATTERN`) of the capture group.
- Optionally, a `$`*n* `type:` key may be defined for each capture group.

### `$`*n* `identifier: CAPTURE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER`

*Required, if an n<sup>th</sup> capture group exists in `PATTERN`*. The programmatic name of the text captured by the *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group of `PATTERN`. Like all other programmatic identifiers in `scig`, `CAPTURE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER` must begin with a standard alphabetic letter followed by alphanumeric characters. Words within `CAPTURE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER` should be separated with underscores (e.g. `my_capture_group_name`).

If `PATTERN` does not contain an *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group but one of these  `$`*n* `identifier:` keys was delcared then a compile warning will occur. If `PATTERN` contains an *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group but the corresponding `$`*n* `identifier:` key was not defined then a compile error shall occur. An invalid, or absent, `CAPTURE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER` will result in a compile error. A duplicate `CAPTURE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER` that has already been defined elsewhere within the `EXPECTED_RESPONSE` will result in a compile error.

### `$`*n* `description: CAPTURE_GROUP_DESCRIPTION`

*Required, if an n<sup>th</sup> capture group exists in `PATTERN`*. A human-readable description of the data captured by the *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group.

If `PATTERN` does not contain an *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group but an `$`*n* `description:` key is defined then a compile warning will occur. If `PATTERN` contains an *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group but a `$`*n* `description:` key is not defined, or `CAPTURE_GROUP_DESCRIPTION` is blank, then a compile error will occur.

### `$`*n* `type: CAPTURE_GROUP_TYPE (string|int|decimal) (default: string)`

*Optional, but there must be an n<sup>th</sup> capture group in `PATTERN`*. The data type of the text captured by the *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group of `PATTERN`. The captured text will be parsed into the `CAPTURE_GROUP_TYPE` at runtime.

`CAPTURE_GROUP_TYPE` must have a value of `string`, `int`, or `decimal`. If the `$`*n* `type:` key is not supplied then `CAPTURE_GROUP_TYPE` shall default to `string`. If `CAPTURE_GROUP_TYPE` is blank or has an invalid value then a compile error will occur. If `PATTERN` does not contain an *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group but an `$`*n* `type:` key is defined then a compile warning will occur. At runtime, if data recieved by the *n*<sup>th</sup> capture group cannot be parsed into `type` then a runtime error will occur.

# `scig` Output Behaviors
The output from `scig` is command dependent. In general, subcommands to `scig start` willâ€”if passed valid arguments and inputsâ€”start an ongoing process of some sort. For this initial implementation, the only supported subcommand is `http`.

## `scig start http` Behaviors
`scig start http` will start a HTTP server (`SERVER`) that listens for requests on the TCP port specified by the `--port` flag (`PORT`).

- The `scig start http` processes uses the `<device_spec_file>` and `<device_port>` arguments to establish a serial connection to the device
- Once a connection to the device has been opened, the process will open a TCP port (identified by `PORT`) and continuously listen for incoming messages as a `SERVER`
- The `SERVER` is a standard HTTP server and will respond as per the `HTTP/1.1` specification
- `SERVER` only supports an `application/json` response format in this initial version
- `SERVER` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `application/json` request formats
- *Some* of the paths and methods supported by `SERVER` shall depend on the supplied `DEVICE_SPEC`
- Regardless of the `DEVICE_SPEC`'s contents, `SERVER` shall generate a `200` (`OK`) response to a `GET` request for its root (`/`)
- `SERVER`'s root (`/`) page exposes information about the device that the `SERVER` is controlling and the structure of other requests that `SERVER` supports
  - Contains a `device` key, which contains the `DEVICE_SPEC` `device:` key values
  - Contains a `connection` key, which contains the `DEVICE_SPEC` `connection:` key values
  - Contains a `status` key, which describes the connection's status
  - Contains a `commands` key, which describes the available commands (as specified in `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`s)
- `SERVER` listens for all incoming TCP messages regardless of source, it does not do any kind of packet source filtering in this implementation

### `SERVER`'s HTTP API
`SERVER`'s API is mostly dictated by the `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`s within the supplied `DEVICE_SPEC`. The main exception to this is the root (`/`) page, which describes the API of the server (in `json`, in this initial version).

Each `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION` in the `DEVICE_SPEC` is exposed as a resource on `SERVER`. The following behaviors apply:
- The command's `identifier` is used as the path for the resource. For example, an identifier of `get_device_name` will be exposed at `http://address:PORT/get-device-name`
- When `SERVER` recieves a `GET` request for the resource, it will perform the following operations:
  - Relevant headers (e.g. `Content-Type`) shall be parsed from the request
  - Relevant parameters shall be decoded (e.g. `newname=New%20Device%20Name` to `newname=New Device Name`)
  - The decoded parameters shall be validated based on the `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION`'s specification of arguments. If a validation error occurs, the server shall send a HTTP response of the following form:

> Status: X
> Message: Invalid parameter value

  - If the decoded parameters are valid, they shall be passed to the underlying method
  - The underlying method shall then send and recieve data from the device. If any errors occur during this pharse, they will be accordingly translated to a corrsponding HTTP error message
  - If no error occured, then the server shall respond with a status code of `OK`. The content of the response shall be the returned data (if any) from the device
